      <description>Name My name is 杨 海平 (Yang Haiping), where the firstname is from a Chinese poem 春江花月夜. The first character 海 means &amp;lsquo;sea/ocean&amp;rsquo;, and the second character 平 means &amp;lsquo;calm/flat&amp;rsquo;.
Work and Research Experience Currently I am a (quantitative) researcher at iSAM, working in the systematic equities group. Previously I was a Ph.D. student at Imperial College London doing pure maths.
While I was doing my Ph.D., I was interested in (geometric) representation theory in general.</description>

      <description>Papers and Preprints
[Skeins on Tori]
A collaboration with Sam Gunningham, David Jordan and Monica Vazirani. We compute the dimension of $SL_n$-skein modules of the 3-dimensional torus, which has a beautiful connection to my second paper.
[Hochschild&amp;ndash;de Rham Homology]
This is my second paper, which is on a generalisation of Poisson&amp;ndash;de Rham Homology of Etingof&amp;ndash;Schedler. Will post to Arxiv at some point&amp;hellip;
On the Derived Ring of Differential Operators on a Singularity</description>
