- Papers and Preprints
  - [Skeins on Tori]

    A collaboration with Sam Gunningham, David Jordan and Monica Vazirani. We compute the dimension of $SL_n$-skein modules of the 3-dimensional torus, which has a beautiful connection to my second paper.

  - [Hochschild--de Rham Homology]

    This is my second paper, which is on a generalisation of Poisson--de Rham Homology of Etingof--Schedler. Will post to Arxiv at some point...

  - [On the Derived Ring of Differential Operators on a Singularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03100.pdf)

    My first paper, which is on the category of D-modules on singular varieties viewed as DG-modules over a DG-algebra. Accepted for Journal of Algebra with revision. 
  

- Notes   
  - [Symplectic Representation Theory](https://www.overleaf.com/read/smbkcqdckxhv)
  
    Notes for a TCC course taught by my PhD supervisor Travis Schedler. It is highly incomplete and probably not readable, quite possibly contain many mistakes too. I would like to go back to this and complete it at some point. 
  
  - [Algebraic K-Theory](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gvhxswcvmxpp)
  
    Some notes I have taken for algebraic K-theory. But in all honesty, I don't remember anything about it at all. 
  - [Modular Representation Theory of Finite Groups](/pdfs/M4R.pdf)
   
    M4R project I did with Prof. Alexander Ivanov during my final undergraduate year.
