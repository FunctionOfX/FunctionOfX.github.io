### Name
My name is 杨 海平 (Yang Haiping), where the firstname is from a Chinese poem 春江花月夜. The first character 海 means 'sea/ocean', and the second character 平 means 'calm/flat'. 

### Work and Research Experience
Currently I am a (quantitative) researcher at [iSAM](https://isam.com/), working in the systematic equities group. Previously I was a Ph.D. student at Imperial College London doing pure maths.

While I was doing my Ph.D., I was interested in (geometric) representation theory in general. More specifically, I was interested in the theory of D-modules and its applications in representation theory. I worked on D-modules on singular varieties, Hochschild homology of quantisations on symplectic singularities and skein modules of tori. I still occasionally think about these things. 

My Ph.D. thesis can be found [here](/pdfs/Thesis.pdf). My Ph.D. research statement can be found [here](/pdfs/Research_Statement.pdf) (last updated 11/2021).
